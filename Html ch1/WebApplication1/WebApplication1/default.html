        I need to relearn how to type because apparently i've gotten a lot worse at it through lack of practice over a couple years
        and this is how i continue another line, it took about two enters'
        wait how "could i quote someone" < as long as it's a space away from a bracket it won't start predicting and going nuts> but that may not be the only way </p>
